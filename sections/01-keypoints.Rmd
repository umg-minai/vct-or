# Key points

- **Question:** How much sevoflurane can be capture by activated charcoal absorbers, CONTRAfluran^TM^, in a routine anaesthesia practice?
- **Findings:** In routine anaesthesia practice, depending on the fresh gas flow and anaesthesia duration, 21 to 48 % of the sevoflurane used could be recovered using CONTRAfluran^TM^.
- **Meaning:** Using minimal or metabolic fresh gas flows is essential for an environmentally friendly anaesthesia, even with activated charcoal absorbers.

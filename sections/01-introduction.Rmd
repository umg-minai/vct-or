# Introduction

The anthropogenic climate crisis is the largest threat to global health [@daalen2022].
However, the health care sector itself is responsible for 5-10 % greenhouse gas emissions [@hu2021a; @hunfeld2022].
Nearly half of these emissions are caused by anaesthetic gases used in anaesthesia and intensive care [@hu2021a].

While sedation should be avoided it is often necessary in intensive care to facilitate mechanical ventilation and invasive procedures [@baron2015].
It has been shown that inhaled in comparison to intravenous sedation might reduce opioid doses, improve spontan-breathing, and decrease time to wake-up and to extubation [@mesnil2011; @meiser2021].
During the COVID-19 pandemic the application of inhaled sedation has increased [@blondonnet2022].
Unfortunately the used inhaled agents, namely isoflurane and sevoflurane, are potent greenhouse gases with a global warming potential that exceeds carbon dioxide 510 and 144 times, respectively [@andersen2012; @andersen2021].
An active carbon filter (CONTRAfluran, ZeoSys Medical GmbH, Germany) captures waste anaesthetic gases from the exhaust of the ventilator.

@hinterberg2022 investigate the efficiency of inhaled anaesthetics recapturing systems in the operating room and found that only 25 % of the vaporised desflurane could be recaptured.
It could be assumed that the recapture rate for isoflurane and sevoflurane would be even lower because of their higher blood-gas coefficients and higher metabolism rate.
In contrast to the operating room patients in the intensive care unit are not necessarily disconnected from the breathing system after the sedation was finished.
The patients might eliminate the inhaled anaesthetic through the active carbon filter completely which should result in an increasing recapture rate.
However, due to leakages in the breathing system, metabolism and water absorption, the fraction of captured anaesthetic gas and the emission-sparing effect is unknown.

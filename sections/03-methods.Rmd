# Methods

In this prospective single-center observational study we collected
`r nrow(agc)` consecutive CONTRAfluran AGC from
`r paste(format(range(c(periods$Start, periods$End)), "%B %Y"), collapse = " to ")`
in two different operating rooms.

In the first operating room (referred to as `r ORnames[1]`),
we mostly took care of patients for ear, nose and throat surgery.
Generally the first and second case each day were children
where we did inhaled inductions with a fresh gas flow in the range of
the minute ventilation of the respective child.
The following cases were mostly adults.
We mostly used supraglottical airways.
All cases, in median `r .as.word(round(ORcases[1]))` cases per day,
were inducted and emerged from anaesthesia in the operating room.

In the second operating room (referred to as `r ORnames[2]`),
we mostly took care of patients for neurosurgical spine surgery.
Here, the median number of cases is `r .as.word(round(ORcases[2]))` per day
and the patients were mostly adults that were intubated.
The first case was always inducted in the operating room,
the following cases sometimes in a special induction room where no AGC was installed.
All cases were emerged from anaesthesia in the operating room.

Following our standard operating procedures a minimal or metabolic flow (< 0.5 L/min, mostly 0.3 L/min) was used during the steady-state phase in all cases.

We used the Draeger connect software (Draeger Medical Deutschland GmbH, Luebeck, Germany) to determine the number and duration of anaesthesia cases.

Volatile anaesthesia was applied using Draeger Perseus A500 anaesthesia machines equipped with bypass vaporizer, Draeger D-Vapor 3000 (Draeger Medicine Deutschland GmbH, Luebeck, Germany).
We weighed the the sevoflurane (SEVOrane, AbbVie Deutschland GmbH & Co. KG, Mainz, Germany) bottles before and after maximum filling of the vapor and use the difference in weigh to record the sevoflurane consumption.
The vapor was maximum filled before we attached the first CONTRAfluran AGC (ZeoSys medical, Luckenwalde, Germany).
If the AGC was exhausted, visible by the red LED and an acoustic warning signal of the SENSOfluran sensor unit (ZeoSys medical, Luckenwalde, Germany), the vapor was filled to the maximum, again.
In case a new bottle of sevoflurane was opened, it was attached to a non-study vapor to lose any excess pressure, subsequently it was weighed before the study vapor was filled.
The weight gain of an AGC was determined by weighing the AGC before usage and after it was exhausted.
Each exhausted AGC was closed and stored in a zip lock bag.
Before returning the AGCs to ZeoSys we weighed all AGCs again.
We measured the weight of the AGCs and sevoflurane bottles with a precision scale (Kern PCB 2500-2; Kern&Sohn GmbH, Balingen-Frommern; Germany; maximum weight=2500g; d=0.01g).

ZeoSys stored all AGCs for further four weeks due to regulatory reasons before starting the desorption and recovery process.
Afterwards they sent us the information about the amount of recovered sevoflurane.

The primary outcome was the amount of recovered sevoflurane.
The secondary outcomes were the avoided carbon dioxide equivalents and the difference of both operating rooms.

All data processing and statistical analyses were performed using R version
`r paste0(sessionInfo()$R.version[c("major", "minor")], collapse = ".")`
[@R-base].
For statistical comparison the two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used.
A *p*-value less than 0.05 was considered a statistically significant difference.
Summary tables were generated using the *gtsummary* package [@Sjoberg2021; @R-gtsummary].

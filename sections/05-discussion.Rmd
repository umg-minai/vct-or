# Discussion

We demonstrated in this prospective single-center observational study that using
active charcoal based canisters for sevoflurane until they reached their maximum saturation
levels can yield a total capture efficiency of `r .pct(CaptureEfficiency, prec = ".0")`.
This represents `r sprintf("%.1f&nbsp;kg", TotalRecoveredSev / 1000)` of sevoflurane
that can be recovered from a total of `r sprintf("%.1f&nbsp;kg", TotalUsedWeightSev / 1000)`
sevoflurane used in our study cohort of `r sum(nCasesSev)` balanced anaesthesia cases.

Interestingly, we saw a large and
significant difference in the proportional capture efficiencies
in the two ORs, with
`r .tbl(tbl_weights, "ProportionalCaptureEfficiency", column = "stat_1", pattern = "{median}&nbsp;%")` for `r ORnames[1]`
and
`r .tbl(tbl_weights, "ProportionalCaptureEfficiency", column = "stat_2", pattern = "{median}&nbsp;%")`  for `r ORnames[2]`.
As `r ORnames[1]` had a higher total number of inductions and far more
inhaled inductions, a higher wastage of sevoflurane during the
induction phase could be a major cause for this difference.
During an inhaled induction
even if done with a fresh gas flow in the range of the minute ventilation
of the respective child, a large amount of sevoflurane passes the patients
without uptake, thus increasing the relative amount that can be captured by the
canister and yielding higher capture efficiency in `r ORnames[1]`.

Another determinant for the lower capture efficiency in `r ORnames[2]`
may be the longer duration of anaesthesia compared to `r ORnames[1]`.
Hinterberg et al. had also recognised a much lower capture efficiency
in longer rather than shorter anaesthesia [@Hinterberg2022].
In shorter anaesthesia cases,
the typically higher and therefore more wasteful fresh gas flow during induction contribute to the higher capture efficiency,
which is reflected in the higher average VA consumption per hour in
`r ORnames[1]` (Table \@ref(tab:table1)B).
During maintenance the vented sevoflurane does not vary substantially,
yielding a nearly constant mass transfer
(if the fresh gas flow and the vaporizer setting is lowered accordingly) [@Dexter2023; @Gibb2024].

Our overall capture efficiency of `r .pct(CaptureEfficiency, prec = ".0")`
is similar to the 25&nbsp;% for desflurane [@Hinterberg2022] and the 43-51&nbsp;%
previously reported for the
AGSS-dependent SageTech Medical's Volatile Capture Device
(SageTech Medical, Paignton, UK; @Gandhi2023) or the 45&nbsp;% *in vivo* mass transfer
for CONTRAfluran^TM^ during laparoscopic surgery [@Mulier2024].
Hinterberg et al. used a new canister for every case, which produced underfilled canisters
with less than 15&nbsp;% of their capacity,
possibly yielding a relative higher contribution of water to the weight gain and
insufficiencies in the desorption and recapture process [@Hinterberg2022; @Kalmar2023].
By contrast, our study represents a routine anaesthesia practice usage of the canisters until they
were saturated and also incorporates the loss during storage.

Despite the difference in the overall capture efficiency, our results
in the different ORs confirm
that a longer duration of minimal-flow anaesthesia reduces
the capture efficiency, as described and simulated previously
[@Hinterberg2022; @Dexter2023; @Gibb2024].
However, the focus on the capture efficiency as a target is misleading as a higher fresh gas
flow yields a higher capture efficiency due to an increased proportion of
anaesthetic wasted and entering the canister [@Shelton2022; @Gandhi2024; @Gibb2024].

The absorption of the VA in the canister is based on strong non-covalent
interactions displacing water [@Gibb2024].
In our study, `r .pct(RatioSevo, prec = ".1")`
was attributable to sevoflurane.
This is in line with the 70&nbsp;% reported previously for CONTRAfluran^TM^ [@Hinterberg2022].
Perhaps a connected AGSS caused a dryer canister, which could be a reason for the very high
desorption efficiency of 95.5&nbsp;% sevoflurane for SageTech's AGSS-dependent volatile capture device [@Gandhi2023].

Although we stored all canisters in a zip lock bag, we found a
decrease in weight of around `r .pct(RatioWeightLoss, prec = ".0")`
during storage (Figure \@ref(fig:plot-weight-lost)).
In contrast a previous study reported a constant weight over time [@Hinterberg2022].
We could not ascertain whether this was due to water evaporation or
spontaneous VA desorption.

The weight loss, the unknown contribution of water and metabolic products,
and the difference in desorption efficiency illustrate
that it is not possible to draw any conclusions about the overall
capture efficiency of canisters from the (*in vivo*) mass transfer alone.

## Limitations

The primary limitation of our study is that we included only two
ORs with a different number of patients and a variety of surgical and
anaesthesia procedures.
Due to the large number of patients per canister, the long observation period and
the pragmatic design, we were not able to analyse
patient- or procedure-related factors like fresh gas flow,
minute ventilation, MAC value, airway devices.
Therefore, our findings in these two ORs cannot be generalised and
should be regarded as exploratory, indicating a further need for research.

The canisters were permanently connected to the exhaust port of the anaesthesia
machines, as it is the common practice in most ORs.
This may have lowered our capture efficiency
due to spontaneous desorption from the canisters and due to
periods with higher fresh gas flows, such as induction, emergence, or total
intravenous anaesthesia where flow-dependent desorption may occur
[@Wenzel2024;@Kalmar2024a].

Seven of `r round(nCases[ORnames[2]])` cases of `r ORnames[2]` were induced in a separate induction room.
This may sligthly under- or overestimate the proportional capture efficiency of the canisters in this OR because
the wasteful induction was not captured and/or an external, unmeasured amount of sevoflurane may introduced.
The intraoperative change of the carbon dioxide absorber was infrequent and should be negligible.

We decided to weigh the sevoflurane bottles instead of the vaporizer to not interrupt the
anaesthesia process by removing/installing the vaporizer during our
measurements and to avoid transporting the vaporizers or the scale into
different ORs.
We validated this method and found a high agreement with a mean difference of
`r sprintf("%.2f&nbsp;g", scalesMeanDiff)` (Supplemental Section S\@ref(cmp-msrmts) and Fig. S\@ref(fig:plot-bland-altmann)).
By weighing the sevoflurane bottles, we measure all, possibly hidden, losses of VAs
(e.g. spilled sevoflurane, losses of the vaporizer) and
the accuracy is enhanced by using a smaller more precise scale.

After the removal of the last exhausted canister, CH0100012088, in `r ORnames[2]`
the vaporizer was not refilled and the weight difference of the sevoflurane bottle
not recorded.
Instead we calculated the sevoflurane consumption data for the four last
anaesthesia cases as described by Biro et al. (Supplemental Section S\@ref(estimation-of-sevoflurane-consumption)) [@Biro2015].
This may
slightly underestimate the *in vivo* mass transfer and proportional
capture efficiency.

ZeoSys needs at least 20 canisters for a single desorption process.
Therefore, we chose to collect the minimum number of 20 consecutive canisters.
A larger number of canisters would have meant significantly more effort
(collecting `r nrow(agc)` canisters in two ORs already took over 6 months and
almost 1000 patients) without a relevant higher information value.
However, a regular desorption process requires 80 canisters.
During the desorption process, the various components of the captured gas
are separated according to their boiling points and densities.
After cooling, the compounds form liquid layers, with sevoflurane at
the bottom due to its high density.
To remove by-products such as acetone and compounds Aâ€“E,
a specific amount of the supernatant is removed.
Therefore, our desorption efficiency and, thus,
our capture efficiency is slightly lower due to a slightly less efficient process compared to a
regular 80 canisters-desorption process.

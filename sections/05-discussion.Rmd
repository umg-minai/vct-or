# Discussion

In this prospective single-center observational study we collected
`r nrow(agc)` consecutive CONTRAfluran AGCs
during the `r .as.word(ceiling(difftime(max(periods$End), min(periods$Start), units = "weeks")))` weeks study period
spanning `r sum(nCases)` anaesthesia cases.
In total `r sprintf("%.1f kg", TotalUsedWeightSev / 1000)` sevoflurane was used
and `r sprintf("%.1f kg", TotalRecoveredSev / 1000)` could be recovered,
yielding a capture efficiency of `r .pct(CaptureEfficiency, prec = ".0")`.

Assuming a greenhouse warming potential over a 100 year time horizont of `r SevoCO2eq["waste"]` we avoided to release
`r sprintf("%.1f", TotalRecoveredSev / 1000 * SevoCO2eq["waste"])` kg carbon dioxide equivalents (CO~2~e) for sevoflurane into the atmosphere [@Nielsen2024].
A life cycle analysis conducted on behalf of Baxter estimates `r CONTRAfluranCO2eq` kg CO~2~e per 1 kg of captured volatile
anaesthetics for canister production, transport, desorption, and disposal
[@Costelloe2022].
@Hu2021 estimated `r sprintf("%.1f", SevoCO2eq["manufacturing"])` CO~2~e for
manufacturing sevoflurane in a best-case scenario.
Using these data and assuming sevoflurane reuse, we produced `r sprintf("%.0f", TotalCO2eq["CONTRAfluran"] / 1000)`
kgCO~2~eq in total (total used sevoflurane x [CO~2~e manufacturing + CO~2~e waste] - recovered sevoflurane x CO~2~e manufacturing + captured sevoflurane x CO~2~e CONTRAfluran).
This calculation ignores the fact, that in theory the same sevoflurane molecule
could be recaptured more than once.

By contrast a conservative estimation of wasting the sevoflurane by an AGSS yield
`r sprintf("%.0f", TotalCO2eq["AGSS"] / 1000)` kgCO~2~e, assuming a best-case scenario where the
system is only connected for the duration of the anaesthesia (ignoring the time
needed to prepare the next case), with power consumption of `r sprintf("%.1f", AGSSkWh)` kWh and `r sprintf("%.3f", kWhCO2eq)` CO~2~e/kWh of the German power grid in 2021 [@Schuster2023].
However, the impact of the power consumption for running the AGSS
for `r sprintf("%.0f", TotalDurationCases / 60)` h,
resulting in `r sprintf("%.1f", (TotalDurationCases / 60) * AGSSkWh * kWhCO2eq)` kg CO~2~e,
is neglectable in this calculation.

In summary we saved around `r sprintf("%.0f", (TotalCO2eq["AGSS"] - TotalCO2eq["CONTRAfluran"]) / 1000)` kg CO~2~e, reducing the carbon footprint by `r .pct((TotalCO2eq["AGSS"] - TotalCO2eq["CONTRAfluran"]) / TotalCO2eq["AGSS"], prec = ".0")`, in these two operating rooms over the `r .as.word(ceiling(difftime(max(periods$End), min(periods$Start), units = "weeks")))` weeks study period.

```{r costs, include = FALSE}
CONTRAfluranAGCcosts <- 35
```

A CONTRAfluran AGC costs around `r sprintf("%.0f", CONTRAfluranAGCcosts)` EUR, yielding `r sprintf("%.0f", nrow(agc) * CONTRAfluranAGCcosts)` EUR costs during our study period.
The power consumption of our AGSS was unknown.
Assuming the previously reported range of 0.1 to 1.6 kWh and a current price of
0.3 EUR per kWh we saved `r paste0(round((TotalDurationCases / 60) * c(0.1, 1.6) * 0.3), collapse = " to ")` EUR by avoiding the AGSS during anaesthesia time (ignoring changing times)[@Schuster2023].
A more realistic example with an AGSS connected for 10 h per working day in both operating rooms yield a cost saving of `r paste0(round(difftime(max(periods$End), min(periods$Start), units = "weeks") * 5 * 10 * 2 * c(0.1, 1.6) * 0.3), collapse = " to ")` EUR.

Our overall capture efficiency of `r .pct(CaptureEfficiency, prec = ".0")`
is very similar to the 43-51 % previously reported for the AGSS-dependent
SageTech Medical's Volatile Capture Device
(SageTech Medical, Paignton, UK; @Gandhi2023) or the 45 % in vivo mass transfer
for CONTRAfluran during laparscopic surgery [@Mulier2024].
@Hinterberg2022 reported a much lower capture efficiency of just 25 % for
desflurane.
They used a new AGC for every case, which caused underfilled AGCs
with less than 15 % of their capacity,
may yielding a relative higher contribution of water to the weight gain and
insufficiencies in the desorption and recovery process [@Kalmar2023].
By contrast, our study represents a 'real-world' usage of the AGCs until they
were saturated.

Despite the difference in the overall capture efficiency our results confirm
that longer duration of low-/minimal-flow anaesthesia reduce
the capture efficiency as described and simulated before
[@Hinterberg2022; @Dexter2023].
However, the focus on capture efficiency is misleading as a higher fresh gas
flow yield a higher capture efficiency due to an increased proportion of
anaesthetic entering the AGC [@Shelton2022; @Gandhi2024].
As @Shelton2022 pointed out: 'if fresh gas flow were
10 times greater than necessary, 90 % of the administered
agent would pass out of the circuit and into the volatile capture device
intraoperatively, potentially leading to a higher
[capture efficiency] despite a clearly wasteful technique'.
They suggest to compare the carbon footprint instead.
Following this, we estimate a worse carbon footprint of
`r sprintf("%.2f", ORCO2eq[1] / (sum(agc$TotalDurationCasesSev[agc$OR == 21]) / 60 ) / 1000)` kg CO~2~e/h of inhaled anaesthesia for
`r ORnames[1]` in comparison to
`r sprintf("%.2f", ORCO2eq[2] / (sum(agc$TotalDurationCasesSev[agc$OR == 25]) / 60 ) / 1000)` kg CO~2~e/h of inhaled anaesthesia,
regardless of the much lower proportional capture efficiency of the latter.
Obviously, the regular inhaled induction of the first one or two cases in `r ORnames[1]` plays a major role but also the
general wash-in/wash-out phase are more significant in the typically shorter duration of anaesthesia.

Assuming a capture efficiency of 70 % @Hu2021 estimated a carbon footprint of
around 1 kg/h, similar to the estimate of a total intravenous anaesthesia.
However, our best estimate of
`r sprintf("%.2f", ORCO2eq[2] / (sum(agc$TotalDurationCasesSev[agc$OR == 25]) / 60 ) / 1000)` kg CO~2~e/h for an inhaled anaesthesia
is still almost twice as high.
In contrast to the steady-state estimates of @Hu2021 our averages incorporate the wash-in/wash-out phases which,
in addtion to the lower capture efficiency, partly explains the higher estimates.

Beside the volatile agent the AGC contains a varying proportion of water, aceton, and, in the case of
sevoflurane, compound A-E.
The absorption of the volatile agent in the AGC is based on strong non-covalent
interactions displacing water and the other components.
In our study `r .pct(TotalRecoveredSev / TotalWeightGain, prec = ".0")`
were attributable to sevoflurane (desorption efficiency).
We believe, the complete saturation of our AGCs explains the higher proportion in
comparison to the 70 % previously reported [@Hinterberg2022].
Maybe a connected AGSS caused a dryer AGC which could be a reason for the very high
desorption efficiency of 95.5 % sevoflurane for SageTech's AGSS-dependent volatile capture device [@Gandhi2023].

Although we stored all AGCs in a zip lock bag we suprisingly found a
linear decrease in weight of around
`r round(fit.weigth.loss$coefficients * 1000)` mg per day during storage (Figure \@ref(fig:plot-weight-lost)).
A previous study reported a constant weight over time [@Hinterberg2022].
Because of the strong non-covalent interaction between the volatile anaesthetic and
the activated charcoal, and the hydrophobic character of the latter,
we assume a drying or evaporation process of the captured water could explain the weight loss.

This weight loss and the difference in desorption efficiency illustrate,
that it is not possible to draw any conclusions about the overall
capture efficiency of AGCs from in vivo mass transfer alone.

## Limitations

The primary limitation of our study is that we included just two
operating rooms with a large number of patients and a variety of procedures.
Due to the large number of patients per AGCs
we weren't able to analyse patient dependent associations in a meaningful way.
Therefore, our findings should be regarded as exploratory,
indicating a further need for research.

Some anaesthesia cases of `r ORnames[2]` were inducted in the anaesthetic room.
This may overestimate the proportional capture efficiency
for the AGCs in this operating room because an external, unmeasured amount of
sevoflurane was introduced.
However, induction in the anaesthetic room was not done on a regular basis and
due to the short duration and
the need to fill the circuit in the operating room
its effect should be small.

In contrast to previous studies that use a new AGC for every case or
use the AGC just for select procedures to infer associations between capture
efficiency and patient charactistics,
we studied a day-to-day use,
that is why our results can be generalised easily to other settings.

The gold standard to determine consumption of volatile anaesthetic is weighing
the vapor before and after the observation period, typically a single
anaesthesia case.
Unfortunately a scale that was precise enough to measure more than 9 kg with
a precision of a few grams was not available.
However, our approach, weighing the sevoflurane bottles, has small advantages
in our scenario.
According to the manual the used vapor, Draeger D-Vapor 3000, loses small
amounts of volatile anaesthetics (< 0.5 ml in 24 hours).
While these loss is small and maybe neglectable,
it can't be measured by weighing the vapor before and after each case.
Ignoring such loss would, slightly overestimate the capture efficiency.
By weighing the bottles we can easily measure all, possible hidden, loss of
volatile anaesthetics and determine the capture efficiency more accurately.

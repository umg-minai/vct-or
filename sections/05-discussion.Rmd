# Discussion

In this prospective single-center observational study we demonstrated that using
active charcoal absorbers for sevoflurane until they reached their maximum saturation
levels can yield a total capture efficiency of `r .pct(CaptureEfficiency, prec = ".0")`.
In our study cohort of `r sum(nCasesSev)` balanced anaesthesia cases this
represents a total amount of `r sprintf("%.1f kg", TotalRecoveredSev / 1000)`
that can be recovered from a total of `r sprintf("%.1f kg", TotalUsedWeightSev / 1000)`
used sevoflurane

Interestingly, we saw a large and
significant difference in the proportional capture efficiencies
in both ORs, with
`r .tbl(tbl_weights, "ProportionalCaptureEfficiency", column = "stat_1", pattern = "{median} %")` for `r ORnames[1]`
and
`r .tbl(tbl_weights, "ProportionalCaptureEfficiency", column = "stat_2", pattern = "{median} %")`  for `r ORnames[2]`.
Despite the different disciplines and procedures, obvious differences
are the inhaled induction and the duration of anaesthesia.
During an inhaled induction, even if done with a fresh gas flow
in the range of the minute ventilation of the respective child, a large amount
of sevoflurane is wasted and cannot be compensated by a following metabolic
flow anaesthesia as could be seen in the large difference in average sevoflurane
consumption per hour.
However, large wastage of VA yields a higher capture efficiency.

Another major determinant for the lower capture efficiency in `r ORnames[2]`
may be the longer duration of anaesthesia.
The slow compartments of the body, e.g. fat, have a huge capacity to store a large amount of
VAs.
Due to the long time constant for sevoflurane
it takes hours to saturate the slow compartments [@Hendrickx2022].
However, even before saturation the absolute amount of VA
in the fat tissue is much larger than in the fast compartments (brain, muscle) and
the blood [@Hendrickx2022].
During the emergence process the fat tissue will release the volatile
anaesthetic slowly as well, due to its small part of the total cardiac output and
the low partial pressure.
The longer the anaesthesia lasts, the more VA will be stored
in the fat tissue and carried to the post anaesthesia care unit where it is
unable to be captured, resulting in a lower capture efficiency.
In a previous simulation study this effect was relatively mild with a 9 %
reduction of the capture efficiency from 82 % after one hour to 73 % after five hours
anaesthesia with sevoflurane and a fresh gas flow of 0.5 l.min^-1^ [@Dexter2023].
Considering the large volume of fat tissue and the
theoretical storage capacity this seems significantly underestimated.
Hinterberg et al. had also recognized much lower capture efficiency
in longer than in shorter anaesthesia [@Hinterberg2022].
Interestingly, Mulier et al. had not seen any correlation between mass transfer
and duration of anaesthesia [@Mulier2024].
With only around 90 min their duration of anaesthesia lasted about half as long
as ours and may be too short for a relevant accumulation
of sevoflurane in the fat tissue, in comparison to the consumption
during induction.
This could be in line with the results of
the simulation study where the largest drop in capture efficiency for
minimal-flow anaesthesia was found between one and two hours [@Dexter2023].

Our overall capture efficiency of `r .pct(CaptureEfficiency, prec = ".0")`
is very similar to the 43-51 % previously reported for the anaesthesia gas
scavenging system (AGSS)-dependent
SageTech Medical's Volatile Capture Device
(SageTech Medical, Paignton, UK; @Gandhi2023) or the 45 % in vivo mass transfer
for CONTRAfluran during laparscopic surgery [@Mulier2024a].
Hinterberg et al. reported a much lower capture efficiency of just 25 % for
desflurane [@Hinterberg2022].
They used a new AGC for every case, which produced underfilled AGCs
with less than 15 % of their capacity,
possibly yielding a relative higher contribution of water to the weight gain and
insufficiencies in the desorption and recapture process [@Kalmar2023].
By contrast, our study represents a 'real-world' usage of the AGCs until they
were saturated.

Despite the difference in the overall capture efficiency our results
in the different ORs confirm
that longer duration of minimal-flow anaesthesia reduces
the capture efficiency as described and simulated before
[@Hinterberg2022; @Dexter2023].
However, the focus on capture efficiency as a target is misleading as a higher fresh gas
flow yield a higher capture efficiency due to an increased proportion of
anaesthetic wasted and entering the AGC [@Shelton2022; @Gandhi2024].

Beside the volatile agent the AGC contains a varying proportion of
water, acetone, and, in the case of sevoflurane, compound A-E.
The absorption of the volatile agent in the AGC is based on strong non-covalent
interactions displacing water and the other components.
In our study `r .pct(TotalRecoveredSev / TotalWeightGain, prec = ".0")`
were attributable to sevoflurane (desorption efficiency).
We believe, the complete saturation of our AGCs explains the higher proportion in
comparison to the 70 % previously reported [@Hinterberg2022].
Maybe a connected AGSS caused a dryer AGC, which could be a reason for the very high
desorption efficiency of 95.5 % sevoflurane for SageTech's AGSS-dependent volatile capture device [@Gandhi2023].

Although we stored all AGCs in a zip lock bag, we suprisingly found a
linear decrease in weight of around
`r round(fit.weigth.loss$coefficients * 1000)` mg per day during storage (Figure \@ref(fig:plot-weight-lost)).
A previous study reported a constant weight over time [@Hinterberg2022].
Because of the strong non-covalent interaction between the VA and
the activated charcoal, and the hydrophobic character of the latter,
we assume a drying or evapouration process of the captured water could explain the weight loss.
However, we recognized some rare exhausting alarms by SENSOfluran during
minimal-flow total intravenous anaesthesia, which may be due spontaneous desorption.
Weight loss during high-flow total intravenous anaesthesia was already reported
[@Mulier2024].
So spontaneous desorption, even without any flow, may be another explanation.

These weight loss and the difference in desorption efficiency illustrate
that it is not possible to draw any conclusions about the overall
capture efficiency of AGCs from in vivo mass transfer alone.

## Limitations

The primary limitation of our study is that we included just two
ORs with a different number of patients and a variety of surgical and
anaesthesia procedures.
Due to the large number of patients per AGC and the pragmatic design
we weren't able to analyse patient related associations, fresh gas flows, and
others procedure related factors in a meaningful way.
Therefore, our findings should be regarded as exploratory,
indicating a further need for research.

In contrast to previous studies that use a new AGC for every case or
use the AGC just for select procedures to infer associations between capture
efficiency and patient characteristics,
we studied a day-to-day use,
that is why our results can be compared easily to other settings.

Seven of `r round(nCases[ORnames[2]])` cases of `r ORnames[2]` were inducted in the separate induction room.
This may overestimate the proportional capture efficiency
for the AGCs in this OR because an external, unmeasured amount of
sevoflurane was introduced.
However, due to the small number of external inductions, the short duration and
the need to fill the circuit in the OR its effect should be negligible.

We didn't record the intraoperative change of the carbon dioxid absorber.
But the influence should also be negligible due to the infrequent changes.

The gold standard to determine consumption of VA is weighing
the vapouriser before and after the observation period, typically a single
anaesthesia case.
Unfortunately, a scale that was precise enough to measure more than 9 kg with
a precision of a few grams was not available.
However, our approach, weighing the sevoflurane bottles, has small advantages
in our scenario.
According to the manual of the vapouriser, the Draeger D-Vapor 3000 loses small
amounts of VAs (< 0.5 ml in 24 hours; equals < 31 mg/h).
While this loss is small and maybe negligible
it can't be measured by weighing the vapour before and after each case.
Ignoring such loss would slightly overestimate the capture efficiency.
By weighing the bottles, we can easily measure all, possible hidden, loss of
VAs and determine the capture efficiency more accurately.

After removal of the last exhausted AGC, CH0100012088, in `r ORnames[2]`
the vapouriser was not refilled, and the weight difference of the sevoflurane bottle
not recorded.
That is why we calculate the sevoflurane consumption data for the four last
anaesthesia cases as described by Biro et al.
(`r sprintf("%.2f g", AGC14EstimatedUsedWeightSev)`; Supplemental Section \@ref(estimation-of-sevoflurane-consumption)) [@Biro2015].
They described an overestimation of the sevoflurane consumption by 6.2 %.
For our AGC CH0100012088 this would result in an error of
`r .pct((AGC14EstimatedUsedWeightSev * 0.062) / agc$TotalUsedWeightSev[agc$Id == "CH0100012088"], prec = ".2")`
and would just slightly underestimate the in vivo mass transfer and proportional
capture efficiency.

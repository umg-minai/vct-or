# Discussion

## Capture efficiency

We demonstrated in this prospective single-center observational study that using
active charcoal based AGCs for sevoflurane until they reached their maximum saturation
levels can yield a total capture efficiency of `r .pct(CaptureEfficiency, prec = ".0")`.
This represents a total amount of `r sprintf("%.1f&nbsp;kg", TotalRecoveredSev / 1000)`
that can be recovered from a total of `r sprintf("%.1f&nbsp;kg", TotalUsedWeightSev / 1000)`
sevoflurane used in our study cohort of `r sum(nCasesSev)` balanced anaesthesia cases.

Interestingly, we saw a large and
significant difference in the proportional capture efficiencies
in the two ORs, with
`r .tbl(tbl_weights, "ProportionalCaptureEfficiency", column = "stat_1", pattern = "{median}&nbsp;%")` for `r ORnames[1]`
and
`r .tbl(tbl_weights, "ProportionalCaptureEfficiency", column = "stat_2", pattern = "{median}&nbsp;%")`  for `r ORnames[2]`.
As `r ORnames[1]` had a higher total number of inductions and far more
inhaled inductions, a higher leakage of sevoflurane during the
induction phase could be a major cause for this difference.
During an inhaled induction using a face mask, the risk of leakage is
generally quite high.
And even if done with a fresh gas flow in the range of the minute ventilation
of the respective child, a large amount of sevoflurane passes the patients
without uptake, thus increasing the amount that can be captured by the
AGC and yielding higher capture efficiency in `r ORnames[1]`.

Another major determinant for the lower capture efficiency in `r ORnames[2]`
may be the longer duration of anaesthesia.
The slow compartments of the body, for example muscles and fat,
have a huge capacity to store a large amount of VA.
It takes hours to saturate the slow compartments
due to the long time constant for sevoflurane [@Hendrickx2022].
However, the absolute amount of VA
in the muscles and fat tissue, even before saturation, is much larger than in
the fast compartments (e.g. brain, heart) and the blood [@Hendrickx2022].
The fat tissue will also release the VA slowly during
the emergence process,
due to its small part in the total cardiac output and the low partial pressure.
The longer the anaesthesia lasts, the more VA will be stored
in the fat tissue and carried to the post anaesthesia care unit, where it is
unable to be captured, resulting in a lower capture efficiency.
This effect was relatively mild in a previous simulation study with a 9&nbsp;%
reduction of the capture efficiency from 82&nbsp;% after one hour to 73&nbsp;% after five hours
anaesthesia with sevoflurane and a fresh gas flow of 0.5&nbsp;l.min^-1^ [@Dexter2023].
Considering the large volume of fat tissue and the
theoretical storage capacity, this seems significantly underestimated and could
partially explained by the wasteful high fresh gas flow during the
induction period over 15 minutes and the high dosage of up to 1.5 minial
alveolar concentration.
Hinterberg et al. had also recognised a much lower capture efficiency
in longer rather than shorter anaesthesia [@Hinterberg2022].
Interestingly, Mulier et al. had not seen any correlation between the *in vivo*
mass transfer and duration of anaesthesia [@Mulier2024].
Their duration of anaesthesia, at around only 90 min, lasted about half as long
as ours and may be too short for a relevant accumulation
of sevoflurane in the fat tissue compared to the consumption during induction.
This could be in line with the results of
the simulation study, where the largest drop in capture efficiency for
minimal-flow anaesthesia was found between one and two hours [@Dexter2023].

## Comparison to other studies

Our overall capture efficiency of `r .pct(CaptureEfficiency, prec = ".0")`
is very similar to the 25&nbsp;% for desflurane [@Hinterberg2022] and the 43-51&nbsp;%
previously reported for the
AGSS-dependent SageTech Medical's Volatile Capture Device
(SageTech Medical, Paignton, UK; @Gandhi2023) or the 45&nbsp;% *in vivo* mass transfer
for CONTRAfluran^TM^ during laparoscopic surgery [@Mulier2024].
Hinterberg et al. used a new AGC for every case, which produced underfilled AGCs
with less than 15&nbsp;% of their capacity,
possibly yielding a relative higher contribution of water to the weight gain and
insufficiencies in the desorption and recapture process [@Hinterberg2022;@Kalmar2023].
By contrast, our study represents a routine anaesthesia practice usage of the AGCs until they
were saturated.

Despite the difference in the overall capture efficiency, our results
in the different ORs confirm
that a longer duration of minimal-flow anaesthesia reduces
the capture efficiency, as described and simulated previously
[@Hinterberg2022; @Dexter2023].
However, the focus on the capture efficiency as a target is misleading as a higher fresh gas
flow yields a higher capture efficiency due to an increased proportion of
anaesthetic wasted and entering the AGC [@Shelton2022; @Gandhi2024].

Beside the volatile agent, the AGC contains a varying proportion of
water, acetone and, in the case of sevoflurane, compound A-E.
The absorption of the volatile agent in the AGC is based on strong non-covalent
interactions displacing water and the other components.
In our study, `r .pct(RatioSevo, prec = ".1")`
was attributable to sevoflurane.
This is in line with the 70&nbsp;% reported previously for CONTRAfluran^TM^ [@Hinterberg2022].
Perhaps a connected AGSS caused a dryer AGC, which could be a reason for the very high
desorption efficiency of 95.5&nbsp;% sevoflurane for SageTech's AGSS-dependent volatile capture device [@Gandhi2023].

## Weight loss

Although we stored all AGCs in a zip lock bag, we found a
decrease in weight of around `r .pct(RatioWeightLoss, prec = ".0")`
during storage (Figure \@ref(fig:plot-weight-lost)).
A previous study reported a constant weight over time [@Hinterberg2022].
Because of the strong non-covalent interaction between the VA and
the activated charcoal, and the hydrophobic character of the latter,
we assume that a drying or evaporation process of the captured water could partially explain the weight loss.
However, we recognised some rare exhausting alarms by SENSOfluran during
minimal-flow total intravenous anaesthesia, which may be due to spontaneous desorption.
Weight loss during high-flow total intravenous anaesthesia was already reported
[@Kalmar2024a].
Thus spontaneous desorption, even without any flow, as already observed by
Wenzel et al. may be another explanation [@Wenzel2024].

The weight loss, the unknown contribution of water and metabolic products,
and the difference in desorption efficiency illustrate
that it is not possible to draw any conclusions about the overall
capture efficiency of AGCs from the (*in vivo*) mass transfer alone.

## Limitations

The primary limitation of our study is that we included only two
ORs with a different number of patients and a variety of surgical and
anaesthesia procedures.
Due to the large number of patients per AGC and the pragmatic design,
we were not able to analyse patient-related associations, fresh gas flows and
other procedure-related factors in a meaningful way.
Therefore, our findings should be regarded as exploratory,
indicating a further need for research.

In contrast to previous studies that used a new AGC for every case or
utilised the AGC only for select procedures to infer associations between capture
efficiency and patient characteristics,
we studied a day-to-day use,
which is why our results can be compared easily to other settings.

The AGCs were permanently connected to the exhaust port of the anaesthesia
machines, as it is the common practice in most ORs.
This may have lowered our capture efficiency
due to spontaneous desorption from the AGCs and due to
periods with higher fresh gas flows, such as induction, emergence, or total
intravenous anaesthesia where flow-dependent desorption may occur
[@Wenzel2024;@Kalmar2024a].

Seven of `r round(nCases[ORnames[2]])` cases of `r ORnames[2]` were inducted in the separate induction room.
This may overestimate the proportional capture efficiency
of the AGCs in this OR because an external, unmeasured amount of
sevoflurane was introduced.
However, due to the small number of external inductions, the short duration and
the need to fill the circuit in the OR, its effect should be negligible.

We did not record the intraoperative change of the carbon dioxide absorber.
However, the influence should also be negligible due to the infrequent changes.

The gold standard to determine the consumption of VA is weighing
the vaporizer before and after the observation period, typically a single
anaesthesia case.
We decided to weigh the sevoflurane bottles instead to not interrupt the
anaesthesia process by removing/installing the vaporizer during our
measurements and to avoid transporting the vaporizers or the scale into
different ORs.
To assess the agreement between these two methods, we weighed the sevoflurane
bottles
(with a Kern PCB 2500-2 scale; Kern\&Sohn GmbH, Balingen-Frommern;
Germany; maximum weight&bnsp;=&bnsp;2500&bnsp;g;&bnsp;d&bnsp;=&bnsp;0.01&bnsp;g)
and the vaporizer
(with a Kern PNJ 12000-M1 scale; Kern&Sohn GmbH, Balingen-Frommern; Germany;
maximum weight&bnsp;=&bnsp;12000&bnsp;g;&bnsp;d&bnsp;=&bnsp;0.1&bnsp;g)
before and after filling of the vaporizer and compared the differences as
described by Bland and Altmann [@Bland1986].
We did `r nrow(scales)` comparisons (`r 4 * nrow(scales)` weight measurements
in total) and found a high agreement with a negligible mean difference of
`r sprintf("%.2f&bnsp;g (95 %% CI: %.2f, %.2f&bnsp;g)", scalesMeanDiff, scalesCIMeanDiff[1L], scalesCIMeanDiff[2L])`.
The 95&bnsp;% limits of agreement are
`r sprintf("%.2f to %.2f&bnsp;g", scalesLADiff[1L], scalesLADiff[2L])`
(Supplemental Fig. S\@ref(fig:plot-bland-altmann)).
To reduce repeated measurement errors the weighing was done on a daily basis
instead after every case and only by two trained investigators (NM and SK).
Beside not interrupting the anaesthesia cases our approach,
weighing the sevoflurane bottles, has small advantages,
because we measure all, possibly hidden, losses of VAs
(e.g. spilled sevoflurane, losses of the vaporizer) and
the accurarcy is enhanced by using the smaller more precise scale.

After the removal of the last exhausted AGC, CH0100012088, in `r ORnames[2]`
the vaporizer was not refilled and the weight difference of the sevoflurane bottle
not recorded.
That is why we calculate the sevoflurane consumption data for the four last
anaesthesia cases as described by Biro et al.
(`r sprintf("%.2f g", AGC14EstimatedUsedWeightSev)`; Supplemental Section \@ref(estimation-of-sevoflurane-consumption)) [@Biro2015].
They described an overestimation of the sevoflurane consumption by 6.2&nbsp;%.
This would result in an error of
`r .pct((AGC14EstimatedUsedWeightSev * 0.062) / agc$TotalUsedWeightSev[agc$Id == "CH0100012088"], prec = ".2")`
for our AGC CH0100012088
and just slightly underestimate the *in vivo* mass transfer and proportional
capture efficiency.

ZeoSys needs at least 20 AGCs for a single desorption process.
However, a regular desorption process requires 80 AGCs.
During the desorption process a specific amount of supernatant is removed.
Therefore, our desorption efficiency and, thus, our capture efficiency is
slightly lower due to a slightly less efficient desorption process in comparsion
to a regular 80 AGCs-desorption process.

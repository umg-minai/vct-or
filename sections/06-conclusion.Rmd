## Conclusion

The capture efficiency of active charcoal based AGCs (CONTRAfluran^TM^)
might depend on various patient- and procedure-related factors, including
the fresh gas flow used and the duration of anaesthesia.
Using metabolic flow, the proportional capture efficiencies were
`r .tbl(tbl_weights, "ProportionalCaptureEfficiency", column = "stat_1", pattern = "{median}&nbsp;%")`
and
`r .tbl(tbl_weights, "ProportionalCaptureEfficiency", column = "stat_2", pattern = "{median}&nbsp;%")`,
respectively, in the two ORs studied.
However, focusing on capture efficiency is misleading.
Further research and independent life cycle analyses are needed
to understand the factors of different capture efficiencies and
determine the carbon footprint of balanced anaesthesia with vapour capture
technology.

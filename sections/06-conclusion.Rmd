# Conclusion

The capture efficiency of active charcoal absorbers (CONTRAfluran^TM^)
may depend on the fresh gas flow used and duration of anaesthesia.
It was higher than previously reported, when the absorbers were used until
they reached their maximum saturation levels.
Using metabolic flow, the proportional capture efficiencies were
`r .tbl(tbl_weights, "ProportionalCaptureEfficiency", column = "stat_1", pattern = "{median} %")`
and
`r .tbl(tbl_weights, "ProportionalCaptureEfficiency", column = "stat_2", pattern = "{median} %")`
, respectively, in the two ORs studied.
However, focusing on capture efficiency is misleading.
Further research and independent life cycle analyses are needed
to understand the factors of different capture efficiencies and
determine the carbon footprint of balanced anaesthesia with vapour-capture
technology.

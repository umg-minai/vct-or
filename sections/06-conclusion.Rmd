# Conclusion

The capture effiency depends on fresh gas flow and duration of anaesthesia, and
was higher for sevoflurane captured by a passive charcoal absorbers (CONTRAfluran)
until they reached the maximum saturation levels than previously reported.
Using metabolic flow the proportional capture efficiencies were
`r .tbl(tbl_weights, "ProportionalCaptureEfficiency", column = "stat_1", pattern = "{median} %")`
and
`r .tbl(tbl_weights, "ProportionalCaptureEfficiency", column = "stat_2", pattern = "{median} %")`
in the two studied operating rooms.
However, focusing on capture efficiency is misleading and the carbon footprint
should be assessed instead.
The estimated carbon footprint for inhaled anaesthesia utilizing metabolic flow
and applying vapor capture technology is still higher than for total intravenous
anaesthesia.
This highlights the most important action, reducing wastage upfront
wherever possible, i.e. critical indication of inhaled anaesthesia and
using metabolic flow.

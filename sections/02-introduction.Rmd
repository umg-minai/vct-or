# Background

The anthropogenic climate crisis is a significant threat to global health [@Daalen2022].
The health-care sector is responsible for 5-10&nbsp;% of greenhouse gas emissions [@Hu2021].
A relevant source of these emissions are volatile anaesthetics (VAs) [@MacNeill2017;@Hu2021].

Active charcoal absorbers can be attached to the exhaust port of
anaesthesia machines to capture VAs and might decrease their emissions.
Using absorbers that allow the recapture of the VAs has the
additional potential benefit of being able to reuse the captured VAs.

Hinterberg et al. [@Hinterberg2022] investigated the efficiency of the active charcoal absorbers, CONTRAfluran^TM^ anaesthetic gas canisters (ZeoSys medical, Luckenwalde, Germany), for VAs in the operating room (OR).
They found that only 25&nbsp;% of the vapourised desflurane could be recaptured.
However, as Kalmar et al. pointed out [@Kalmar2023], the desorption process to recapture the substances from the canister is highly dependent on the saturation level, with a higher capture efficiency for full, i.e. saturated canisters.
Therefore, it expected that a higher efficiency could be obtained, when canisters are used to a higher saturation level than the 15&nbsp;% in the study by Hinterberg et al. [@Kalmar2023; @Hinterberg2022].

We conducted this exploratory study to investigate the efficiency of passive canisters for sevoflurane and the entire recapture process when canisters for sevoflurane are used to higher saturation levels in a routine anaesthesia practice.

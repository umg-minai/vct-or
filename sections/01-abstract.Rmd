# Abstract

**Background**:
Volatile anaesthetics are potent greenhouse gases, but can be captured using
active charcoal absorbers on the exhaust port of anaesthesia machines to reduce
their negative climate impact.
Previous studies investigating the capture efficiency of absorbers have been
performed mostly under circumstances that differ from everyday clinical routine.
Therefore, we here investigated the
capture efficiency of the CONTRAfluran^TM^ absorbers for sevoflurane
in routine anaesthesia practice.

**Methods**:
In this prospective single-centre study, we collected
`r nrow(agc)` consecutive CONTRAfluran^TM^ absorbers from two
different operating rooms (ORs) after they were saturated to their maximum
saturation levels.
After storage and transport, the sevoflurane was recaptured from the absorbers by
the absorber manufacturer.
To calculate the capture efficiency, we divided the amount of recaptured
sevoflurane by the total sevoflurane consumption during the use of the
absorbers, which was obtained by
comparing the weight
of the sevoflurane bottles before versus after refilling the vaporizers.

**Results**:
We observed `r sum(nCasesSev)` balanced anaesthesia cases.
A total of
`r sprintf("%.1f&nbsp;kg", TotalUsedWeightSev / 1000)` sevoflurane was used and
`r sprintf("%.1f&nbsp;kg", TotalRecoveredSev / 1000)` could be recovered,
yielding a capture efficiency of `r .pct(CaptureEfficiency, prec = ".0")`.
The capture efficiencies differed significantly between the ORs, with
`r .tbl(tbl_weights, "ProportionalCaptureEfficiency", column = "stat_1", pattern = "{median}&nbsp;%")` in the OR with shorter anaesthesia durations and frequently inhaled induction
versus
`r .tbl(tbl_weights, "ProportionalCaptureEfficiency", column = "stat_2", pattern = "{median}&nbsp;%")`  in the OR with longer anaesthesia duration.
We saw a `r .pct(RatioWeightLoss, prec = ".0")` weight loss over time during storage.

**Conclusions**:
If CONTRAfluran^TM^ absorbers are used until they are fully saturated,
almost one-third of the sevoflurane can be recaptured, but
the capture efficiency depends highly on the fresh gas flow used and duration of
anaesthesia.

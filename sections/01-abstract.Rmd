# Summary

**Background**:
Volatile anaesthetics are potent greenhouse gases.
Active charcoal absorbers can be attached to the exhaust port of the anaesthesia
machine to recapture the volatile anaesthetics reducing their negative climate impact.
The capture efficiency of the passive CONTRAfluran absorbers are unknown
for sevoflurane in a 'real-world' scenario.

**Methods**:
In this prospective single-center observational study we collected
`r nrow(agc)` consecutive CONTRAfluran anaesthetic gas canisters from two
different operating rooms (ORs) after they were saturated to their maximum
saturation levels.
Additionally we recorded the sevoflurane consumption by weighting the difference
of the sevoflurane bottles after refilling the vapor.
The primary outcome was the amount of recovered sevoflurane.
The secondary outcomes were the difference of both ORs and the avoided emissions in carbon dioxide equivalents (CO~2~e).

**Results**:
During our study of `r sum(nCasesSev)` balanced anaesthesia cases
`r sprintf("%.1f kg", TotalUsedWeightSev / 1000)` sevoflurane was used and
`r sprintf("%.1f kg", TotalRecoveredSev / 1000)` could be recovered
yielding a capture efficiency of `r .pct(CaptureEfficiency, prec = ".0")`.
We saw a significantly difference in the proportional capture efficiencies
in both ORs, with
`r .tbl(tbl_weights, "ProportionalCaptureEfficiency", column = "stat_1", pattern = "{median} %")` for `r ORnames[1]`
and
`r .tbl(tbl_weights, "ProportionalCaptureEfficiency", column = "stat_2", pattern = "{median} %")`  for `r ORnames[2]` due to inhaled induction in the former and longer duration of anaesthesia in the latter.
Using CONTRAfluran we avoided to release
`r sprintf("%.1f", TotalRecoveredSev / 1000 * SevoCO2eq["waste"])` kg CO~2~e
for sevoflurane into the atmosphere.
Assuming sevoflurane reuse this would have
saved around `r sprintf("%.0f", (TotalCO2eq["AGSS"] - TotalCO2eq["CONTRAfluran"]) / 1000)` kg CO~2~e, reducing the carbon footprint by `r .pct((TotalCO2eq["AGSS"] - TotalCO2eq["CONTRAfluran"]) / TotalCO2eq["AGSS"], prec = ".0")`
in both ORs compared to using the anaesthesia gas scavenging system.

**Conclusions**:
The capture effiency depends on fresh gas flow and duration of anaesthesia.
Almost half of the sevoflurane could be recaptured, if the CONTRAfluran
absorbers were used until saturated, reducing the
the carbon footprint by around a third.

# Summary

**Background**:
Volatile anaesthetics are potent greenhouse gases.
Active charcoal absorbers can be attached to the exhaust port of the anaesthesia
machine to recapture the volatile anaesthetics reducing their negative climate impact.
The capture efficiency of the CONTRAfluran absorbers for sevoflurane, without an
anaesthetic gas scavenging system connected, is unknown in a 'real-world' scenario.

**Methods**:
In this prospective single-center exploratory observational study we collected
`r nrow(agc)` consecutive CONTRAfluran absorbers from two
different operating rooms (ORs) after they were saturated to their maximum
saturation levels.
Additionally, we recorded the sevoflurane consumption by comparing the weight
of the sevoflurane bottles after refilling the vaporisers.
The primary outcome was the amount of recaptured sevoflurane.
The secondary outcomes were the difference between in vivo mass transfer and
recapture rate reported by ZeoSys, the difference in sevoflurane recovery
between both ORs and the weight loss of the absorbers during storage.

**Results**:
We observed `r sum(nCasesSev)` balanced anaesthesia cases.
In total
`r sprintf("%.1f kg", TotalUsedWeightSev / 1000)` sevoflurane was used and
`r sprintf("%.1f kg", TotalRecoveredSev / 1000)` could be recovered
yielding a capture efficiency of `r .pct(CaptureEfficiency, prec = ".0")`.
We saw a significant difference in the proportional capture efficiencies
in both ORs, with
`r .tbl(tbl_weights, "ProportionalCaptureEfficiency", column = "stat_1", pattern = "{median} %")` for `r ORnames[1]`
and
`r .tbl(tbl_weights, "ProportionalCaptureEfficiency", column = "stat_2", pattern = "{median} %")`  for `r ORnames[2]` may due to inhaled induction in the former and longer duration of anaesthesia in the latter.
During storage we saw a weight loss over time of around
`r round(fit.weigth.loss$coefficients * 1000)` mg per day per absorber.

**Conclusions**:
The capture efficiency may depends on fresh gas flow used and
duration of anaesthesia.
If CONTRAfluran absorbers were used until saturated,
almost half of the sevoflurane could be recaptured.
But further research and independent life cycle analyses are needed
to understand the factors of different capture efficiencies and
to determine the carbon footprint of balanced anaesthesia with vapor capture
technology.

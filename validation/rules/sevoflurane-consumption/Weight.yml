  label: 'weight per bottle'
  description: |
    Ensure weight loss is not more than a bottle (250 ml) sevoflurane
    (density 1.52), and a little tolerance of 1/2 1%
    (weight error in multiple measurements).
- expr: c(500, head(InitialWeight, -1)) * 1.002 > InitialWeight | c(0, head(Id, -1)) < Id
  name: 'RWC2'
  label: 'weight comparision'
  description: |
    InitialWeight has to be descreasing from row to row except
    we used a new bottle (add 0.2 % tolerance for measurement tolerance/errors).
